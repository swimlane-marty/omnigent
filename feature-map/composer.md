# Composer

The composer is where a user writes a message and chooses how the agent runs
it. It appears in two places that look alike but are separate surfaces: the
in-session composer at the bottom of a chat, and the new-session composer on
the landing page. Both show a model/effort pill with a hover tooltip, open a
configuration menu for harness, model, reasoning effort, and permission mode,
and accept attachments and slash commands. The in-session composer also queues
and steers messages while the agent is busy.

## Sub-features

- `pill-tooltip`: hovering the pill shows one tooltip with Harness, Model, and
  Connection rows (plus effort when the harness has it).
- `pill-tooltip-suppressed`: the tooltip stays hidden while the model picker is
  open and does not reappear when the picker closes.
- `pill-opens-config`: clicking anywhere on the highlighted pill label opens the
  configuration menu.
- `model-picker`: lists the host's live model catalog, highlights the current
  model, and keeps the selection. States: catalog loading, delayed catalog,
  alias vs. full model ID.
- `effort-picker`: reasoning effort for harnesses that support it (Codex, Claude,
  Pi). States: available, unavailable placeholder, max/ultra levels.
- `effort-terminal-mirror`: an effort change typed in the Codex terminal shows
  in the composer, and a composer pick is not reverted by later terminal turns.
- `permission-mode`: the harness's native approval modes; the current mode is
  marked and the choice persists.
- `slash-menu`: typing `/` opens commands and skills with keyboard navigation.
- `attachments`: attach button, paste, and drop onto the transcript; chips can
  be removed. State: unsupported file type rejected without losing the message.
- `send-shortcut`: Enter or Mod+Enter, chosen in settings; only one gesture sends.
- `queue-and-steer`: messages sent while the agent is busy wait in a queue and
  can be steered into the running turn.
- `browser-pointer-queue`: desktop Design-mode instructions follow the same queue
  and always-steer preference, keeping their element screenshots.
- `pi-compact`: `/compact` follows the normal queue/Always steer preference.
  Send now interrupts the turn and compacts. During compaction, queued messages
  wait in the web queue; immediate sends are retained by the Pi integration.
- `draft-persistence`: unsent text survives arriving messages and prompts.
- `mobile-labels`: on narrow screens labels collapse to icons without
  overlapping the stop button.
- `live-markdown`: Markdown in the draft is styled as it is typed, glyph for
  glyph over the textarea, with markers hidden until the caret edits them; the
  sent text is exactly what was typed. States: code blocks, quotes, reply-quote
  blocks, right-to-left text, long drafts.
- `markdown-typing-aids`: typed `*`, `_` and backticks get their closers, stray
  spaces inside emphasis tidy, and ``` makes a code block; each is one undo.
- `compact-preview`: once the composer loses focus, hidden markers take no
  space and code fences collapse; a click puts the caret on the character.

## How to get to it (user POV)

**In-session composer** (open any session):

- Hover the model/effort pill to see the tooltip; click it to open configuration.
- In configuration, open the model picker, the effort picker, or the permission
  mode menu.
- For a Codex session, open the Terminal view and change effort there, then
  return to Chat.
- Type `/` in the message box; attach files with the button, by paste, or by
  dropping them on the transcript.
- Send while the agent is working to queue a message, then steer it.

**Desktop browser pointer** (open a session in the desktop app):

- Choose **+ → Browser** to open a Browser soft tab, navigate to a page, enable
  Design mode, and click an element. Type an instruction in the floating popup
  and use Send or Enter.
- Change Settings → Always steer to choose whether busy-session follow-ups
  queue or send immediately. Existing queued messages retain FIFO ordering.

**New-session composer** (landing page, or New session):

- From any page, press ⌘/Ctrl+Alt+N to open and focus a clean new-session
  composer.
- Hover the model/effort pill to see the tooltip.
- Pick a harness, then open its configuration for model, effort (Codex, Claude,
  Pi), and permission mode before the session exists.
- Attach files or type `/` before the first send.

**Mobile** (either composer on a phone-sized viewport): the same controls with
collapsed labels.

**Live Markdown** (either composer, and the side chat): type `**bold**`,
`_italic_`, `` `code` ``, ``` for a block, or `> ` for a quote; click away to
see the compact preview, then click a word in it to edit there.

## Driving it with the repro environment

Preconditions: a running instance (`verify-env start`, then `verify-env
doctor`), the built web UI, and mock replies configured for any journey that
sends a message. Run e2e tests through the instance:

```sh
verify-env run -- python -m pytest <test> --ui-skip-build --video=on \
  --output="$VERIFY_EVIDENCE/composer"
```

Tests under `tests/browser_ui/` stub every backend call and need no instance:
`uv run pytest <test> --browser-ui-skip-build --video=on --output="$VERIFY_EVIDENCE/composer"`.

  `tests/browser_ui/chat/test_composer_tooltips.py::test_pill_uses_one_tooltip_and_suppresses_it_while_picker_is_open`
  (runs with zero and one turn).
- **`pill-tooltip`, new-session composer:** no browser-level coverage; the web
  unit tests for the new-session dialog cover it. Manually: open the landing
  page, hover the pill, and expect the same styled rows as in a session, not a
  plain browser title tooltip.

- **`browser-pointer-queue`, desktop:** manually hold an agent turn open, then
  send a normal composer follow-up and two pointer instructions (Send and Enter).
  With Always steer off, all three stay queued and the popup says "Queued for
  agent." After the turn ends, verify FIFO delivery and each pointer screenshot.
  Repeat in a fresh session with Always steer on: both entry points send while
  busy and the pointer popup says "Sent to agent." If older messages are already
  queued, new pointer instructions must join them even with Always steer on.
- **`pi-compact`:** in a Pi session, start a long turn, type `/comp`, press Tab,
  then Enter. With Always steer off, confirm `/compact` queues; use Send now to
  interrupt and compact. With Always steer on and an empty queue, Enter should
  compact immediately. During compaction, send a follow-up in each mode: normal
  queue mode keeps its queue row; Always steer hands it to Pi. Both should run
  once after compaction. Repeat the queued flow while viewing another session.

## Gotchas

- The in-session and new-session composers are different surfaces. A change to
  the pill, tooltip, configuration menu, or effort picker in one does not reach
  the other. Verify both, plus the mobile layout.
- "New session" in a test name can mean a session with no turns yet, not the
  landing page. Check which surface the test opens.
- Tooltip changes need a hover after the picker closes, not only on first load.
  A tooltip that returns after clicking away is a regression.
- Effort exists only for some harnesses. Check at least one harness with effort
  and one without, since the pill and tooltip rows change.
- Codex effort can change from the terminal as well as the composer. Confirm the
  terminal command actually landed before blaming the mirror.
- The mock environment configures Claude and Codex only. Other harnesses'
  catalogs need real CLIs or credentials.
- Live Markdown has two views: the aligned layer while focused and the compact
  preview when not. Check a change in both, and type it key by key: `fill()`
  skips the typing aids.
